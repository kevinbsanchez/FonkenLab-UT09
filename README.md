# Introduction
Data from the UT9 experiments investigating timing of estrogen loss in aged mice, behavior, and neuroinflammation. The **hypothesis** is that aged mice that received an ovariectomy (OVX) earlier in life would have greater impairments in memory and cognition. This would be accompanied by greater neuroinflammation. Treatment with a sustained-release estradiol capsule would lead to improvements in these behavioral deficits and neuroinflammation.

## Experimental Design
Species and Strain: Mice, C57BL/6 <br>
Age: 7-month-old (young) and 18-month-old (aged) <br>
Age at Ovariectomy: 4 months old (young sham), 12 months old (early-OVX), and 15 months old (late-OVX and aged sham)

## Experimental Groups
- Young + Sham + Vehicle
- Aged + Sham + Vehicle
- Aged + Early-OVX + Vehicle
- Aged + Early-OVX + Estradiol
- Aged + Late-OVX + Vehicle
- Aged + Late-OVX + Estradiol
